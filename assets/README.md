# WhereisBART.com

Whereisbart.com is a live visualization of the estimated positions of all BART ([Bay Area Rapid Transit](http://bart.gov)) trains.  The positions are estimated using realtime arrival predictions from the [BART API](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api.aspx).  The estimated travel time between all stations was determined and trains are plotted on a map.  The map assumes normal operating conditions - any delays in the BART system will cause the estimated positions on the map to be inaccurate.

The map layer is the [Google Transit layer](http://blinktag.com/google-transit-layer-through-google-maps-api/).

The data is refreshed every 15 seconds.
